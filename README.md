# Overview

A simple, automated punch clock to track employee hours. Uses Python script running under systemd, cron for job automation, MySQL (MariaDB) database, and an NGINX web server for database management (PHPMyAdmin). Based on RPi and RC522 RFID module.

# TODO

- write setup.txt into a proper setup guide
- deploy the program onto RaspberryPi with Ansible
